# User Input/Output

If you’ve worked with JavaScript before, you’re likely familiar with the concept of *input/output* even if you haven’t heard it called that. At its most abstract, output is any data or feedback that a computer provides (like to a human user), while input is data provided to the computer. When we use ``console.log()`` we prompt the computer to output information to the console. In the Node environment, the console is the terminal, and the ``console.log()`` method is a “thin wrapper” on the ``.stdout.write()`` method of the ``process`` object. ``stdout`` stands for standard output.

In Node, we can also receive input from a user through the terminal using the ``stdin.on()`` method on the ``process`` object:

```javascript
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
  let input = userInput.toString()
  console.log(input)
});
```

Here, we were able to use ``.on()`` because under the hood ``process.stdin`` is an instance of ``EventEmitter``. When a user enters text into the terminal and hits enter, a ``'data'`` event will be fired and our anonymous listener callback will be invoked. The ``userInput`` we receive is an instance of [the Node Buffer class](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer), so we convert it to a string before printing.
